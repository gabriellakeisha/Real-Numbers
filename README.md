# Real-Numbers
Define a class named Real representing Real valued numbers.
• This class must have:
• A private member called real representing the number
• A public function called getReal() to have access to the private meber
• For that class define all the functions necessary to perform
• Sum between real numbers;
• Difference between Real numbers;
• Multiplication between real numbers;
• Division between real numbers;
Extend the class Real through public inheritance and by creating a new
class named Complex representing complex numbers.
• A complex number in mathematics is defined as a + i *b where:
• a and b are real numbers, and are called real part and imaginary part,
respectively.
• i represents the square root of -1. This means i ^2 =-1.
• This class must have:
• A private member called real representing the real part.
• A private member called imag representing the immaginary part.
• A public function called getReal() to have access to the real part
• A public function called getImag() to have access to the immaginary part
Include member functions that performs the operations: 
• Sum of complex numbers;
• Difference of complex numbers;
• Multiplication of complex numbers;
• Division of complex numbers.

Write a main source file which will do the following:
• Ask to insert your student number
• If student number%3 == 0 you will create two real numbers and perform all
the operations.
• else if number%3 == 1 you will be asked to create two complex numbers
and performs all the operations.
• Else You create broth two real numbers and two complex numbers and
performs the operations of the of them.
